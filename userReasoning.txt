{
    "Coding Style and Structure": "The tester uses a lot of macros (#define) and non-standard input/output methods (scanf, printf).  The master uses more modern C++ features like `using i64 = long long` and `std::cin/cout`, providing better readability and potentially improved performance. The tester's code often lacks functions to modularize the code, unlike the master's solutions which use functions to separate concerns and improve organization.",
    "Core Solution Analysis": "The tester's solutions implement the core logic of each problem directly in the main function, often lacking clarity and structure. The master's code uses separate functions (`solve()`), leading to better organization and readability. The algorithms used are generally similar, but the master's implementation is more concise and efficient.",
    "Complexity Analysis": "The tester's code's complexity varies widely depending on the problem; for example, problem 1 has a time complexity that's difficult to bound (related to the Collatz conjecture), and problem 3 has O(n!), while problem 4 has O(n*2^n). The master's solutions show better complexity control. Space complexity is generally O(n) in most of the tester's solutions, similar to the master's but with potential for better optimization by the master.",
    "Data Structures Used": "The tester uses basic data structures like vectors, bitsets, and sets.  The master also uses maps in Problem 3 for efficient counting, showcasing a better choice of data structure for that specific task.  While the tester's choices work, the master sometimes demonstrates more efficient data structures for the problems.",
    "Algorithm Identification": "The tester's solutions use brute force (problems 2, 4), recursion (problem 3), and iterative approaches (problem 1, 5).  The master's solutions show efficient algorithms for problems where the tester's brute force may be suboptimal, highlighting a more sophisticated approach to problem-solving. Problem 2 demonstrates where the tester's naive method (brute force) is acceptable, while the master's more efficient solution would still be preferred for larger input sizes.",
    "Potential Errors and Edge Cases": "The tester's code might have potential issues with edge cases or unexpected inputs in several problems. Problem 1's unbounded time complexity needs more attention. Problem 3's permutation solution lacks error handling for large input strings. The master's solutions generally show greater robustness and awareness of edge cases.",
    "Code Readability and Formatting": "The tester's code readability is hampered by inconsistent indentation, excessive use of tabs, and less descriptive variable names. The master's code has better formatting and more descriptive naming conventions, making it easier to understand. The excessive use of macros by the tester also reduces readability."
